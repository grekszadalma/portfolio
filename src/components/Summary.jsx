        Hi! Welcome to my page 👋
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        My name is Dalma Júlia Greksza. I’m a Hungarian software engineer currently living in Grenoble, France.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        I was born in 2000 in Szeged, Hungary, and lived there until I was 19 and moved to Budapest for university.
       
        In high school, I was especially drawn to foreign languages, mathematics, and IT.
        At one point, I couldn’t decide whether to study mathematics or computer science.
        I eventually chose computer science, knowing it would give me more flexibility and opportunities later on.
        In 2019, I started my BSc in Computer Science at Eötvös Loránd University.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        During my Bachelor studies, I explored both applied mathematics and programming.
        I especially enjoyed discrete mathematics, programming in Java and Python,
        and working on web development projects.
      </p>

        In 2022, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and applied for an Erasmus exchange program.
        My curiosity about French culture and my love for skiing brought me to Grenoble, France for a year,
        where I followed a professional bachelor’s program in Computer Networks, Mobility, and Cybersecurity.
        This experience truly changed my life. Not only did I gain solid knowledge in computer networks that I
        hadn’t encountered before, but I also had the chance to meet a lot of cool and nice people.
        It’s a year I wouldn’t trade for anything.
      </p>

        <p>
  In 2023, I was accepted into the Master RIE program at the renowned French engineering school Ensimag.
  I completed the degree through an apprenticeship, working on several exciting projects along the way.
  This experience allowed me to strengthen my skills in full-stack development, systems engineering, and cybersecurity.
</p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
  I’ve been fascinated by foreign languages for as long as I can remember. I started learning French at 10 and English at 12.
  Understanding people speaking different languages around me always felt a bit like being a spy (minus the cool gadgets),
  and it sparked my curiosity for other cultures. On family vacations, I proudly served as my parents’ personal translator,
  mostly negotiating hotel check-ins and restaurant menus, since they spoke neither English nor French.
</p>

  I love traveling and get to know new cultures. One of my dreams is to do an Europe road trip in a van.
</p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I practice weightlifting and swimming. I also enjoy reading and watching series,
        especially mystery, thriller, and fantasy. My current favorite author is Freida McFadden - she’s
        really killing it!

        Hi! Welcome to my page 👋
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        My name is Dalma Júlia Greksza. I’m a Hungarian software engineer currently living in Grenoble, France.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        I was born in 2000 in Szeged, Hungary, and lived there until I moved to Budapest for university.
        I’ve been interested in languages for as long as I can remember. I started learning French at the age of 10
        and English at 12. Being able to understand people speaking different languages around me always felt a bit
        like being a spy, and it made me curious about other cultures.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        In high school, I was especially drawn to foreign languages, mathematics, and IT.
        At one point, I couldn’t decide whether to study mathematics or computer science.
        I eventually chose computer science, knowing it would give me more flexibility and opportunities later on.
        In 2019, I started my BSc in Computer Science at Eötvös Loránd University.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        During my studies, I explored both applied mathematics and programming.
        I especially enjoyed discrete mathematics, programming in Java and Python,
        and working on web development projects.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        In 2022, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and applied for an Erasmus exchange program.
        My curiosity about French culture and my love for skiing brought me to Grenoble, France for a year,
        where I followed a professional bachelor’s program in Computer Networks, Mobility, and Cybersecurity.
        This experience truly changed my life. Not only did I gain solid knowledge in computer networks that I
        hadn’t encountered before, but I also had the chance to practice both my English and French.
        It’s a year I wouldn’t trade for anything.
      </p>

        In my free time, I practice weightlifting and swimming. I also enjoy reading and watching series,
        especially mystery, thriller, and fantasy. My current favorite author is Freida McFadden — she’s
        really killing it!
